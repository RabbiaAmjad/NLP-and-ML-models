🧠 Mental Health Classification using NLP & Machine Learning

📌 Overview:
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning on data taken from Kaggel, to classify text statements into mental health categories such as:
Anxiety
Depression
Suicidal
Normal
The model analyzes textual patterns and sentiment to predict mental health status.

🚀 Features:
Text cleaning and preprocessing
Sentiment analysis using TextBlob
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
WordCloud visualization
TF-IDF feature extraction
Logistic Regression classification
Confusion matrix & performance evaluation
Feature importance interpretation

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
TextBlob
Scikit-learn
WordCloud

📊 Workflow:
Data Cleaning
Sentiment Analysis
Visualization (EDA)
TF-IDF Vectorization
Logistic Regression Model Training
Model Evaluation
Interpretation of Important Features

🤖 Model Details:

Model Used:
Logistic Regression
class_weight='balanced' (to handle class imbalance)

Feature Engineering:
TF-IDF Vectorizer (max_features=5000)
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Confusion Matrix

📈 Key Insights:
Negative sentiment strongly correlates with Depression and Suicidal categories.
Logistic Regression performs effectively for text classification.
Important keywords significantly influence predictions.

📌 Future Improvements:
Implement Naive Bayes and SVM
Use Deep Learning models (BERT, LSTM)
Deploy as a Web Application
Improve sentiment analysis using domain-specific models
